In this presentation, I would like to explain some vital parts of this workshop: what kind of part of the workshop is hard to figure out, how to handle it, etc. This presentation touches upon 

 To begin with, one of the important learned concepts is on understanding the relationship between base and derived classes's features of C++ language. The main modules are the Container and Pack which offer a useful perspective on inheritance and method in object-oriented programming.

The Pack class, derived from the Container, illustrated inheritance brilliantly. For instance, in the constructor 

Pack::Pack(const char* content, int size, double unitSize, int numUnits), 

the call to the base class Container constructor integrates inherited properties, showing inheritance in action.

On the other hand, The Pack class redefines certain functions from Container, exemplifying method shadowing.
Pack::print(std::ostream& os) const, the function not only calls the base class's print method but also adds its unique implementation, demonstrating how derived classes can extend base class functionalities

To sum up, One challenge was ensuring that the shadowed methods in Pack correctly utilized and extended the functionalities of Container. This required a deep understanding of how inheritance and method overriding work in C++. Additionally, managing the balance between leveraging inherited methods and adding new functionalities in Pack was a valuable learning experience.
